    "story": "The Feldans are an ordinary nomad tribe in the middle of Northern Vale. Like many local people, they reside near the forest and live a peaceful and slow-paced life as hunters.But there was one exception. Popol, a naughty boy who had been known as the expert prankster and little adventurer of the tribe, always seemed to be at the center of attention. Unlike the other quiet and composed Northern Valers, he was full of vigor and imagination. Thanks to the warrior tradition of Northern Vale, Popol mastered the art of spear-throwing since his childhood. He often joined the adults in their hunting and returned with a cart full of prey.Listening to the adults singing songs about legendary heroes after drinking was his favorite pastime. He dreamt of becoming one of them and also have his name sung by others like Popol the Fearless.However, his tribesmen didn't take his ambition seriously and laughed about it as some childish daydream. Popol apparently couldn't stand that. In order to impress the others, he pulled all kinds of well-schemed pranks on them, resulting only in the villagers, especially kids, seeing him as a freak and stayed away from him.The more alienated he was, the more eager he became to draw their attention by pulling even more pranks. However, that kept achieving opposite effects. In the end he had no friends left.Alone and desperate, he decided to do something extraordinary to reverse his image once and for all.On a dark night, Popol left the village and ventured into the mountains. He planned to kill a ferocious frost wolf all by himself to impress the others.He stumbled into the thick forest and investigated his surroundings curiously. He lost orientation in the dark and fell into a trap.The first thing he saw at the bottom of the hole was a pair of green glowing eyes, which scared him off his feet. But when moonlight shone into the trap, he saw the owner of the eyes - a trapped frost wolf whom he later gave the name Kupa. One of its front feet was clamped by a beast trap and due to starvation, it could barely move.Popol could have killed Kupa there and then, but when he raised his spear, he saw the same loneliness in Kupa's eyes. If he killed Kupa, he would be completely alone in the darkness of the trap. Hesitantly, he put down the spear and tried to help Kupa.At first they were defensive and hostile towards other . But in time, the two lonely souls finally lowered their guard and regarded the other as the same kind. The beast trap became the bridge of their friendship. And perhaps due to their loneliness, Popol treated Kupa as a listener and playmate. He even playfully threw a snow ball on its head.But at this point, Kupa was almost starving to death. Popol hesitated for a while before sharing the food he carried with the dying Kupa.However, Popol decided to feed Kupa and Kupa was eventually saved from starvation. In its mind, all humans were cold and ruthless like the hunters. It is always a life-and-death situation between them and the frost wolves. But Popol was different. Having been hunted alone in the forest since it was born, Kupa felt kindness and warmth for the first time from Popol.Days passed, and the two formed a subtle friendship. But the first visitors were not people coming to rescue them, but a group of vultures. They flocked to the trap and began to attack. Popol threw spears at the vultures, but he couldn't fend them off while Kupa could only fight aimlessly with one free paw.Under the continuous harassment of the vultures, they were becoming the birds' meal. It was at this time of danger, Popol made a remarkable decision - he threw down the spear and with all his strength, tore open the beast trap, in order to help Kupa escape. With his back exposed, he was caught by a vulture and lifted off the trap in mid air. Just as Popol's hope was lost, a thundering roar broke out. Kupa leapt out of the pit and bit the vulture, freeing Popol from its grasp.Now, with both fightingd side by side, Popol and Kupa demonstrate incredible synergy and repelled all the vultures for good. Henceforth, they became best partners in adventure.They travelled the frozen land and together, began a new chapter of adventure.",
